[00:21.74]Hear it in your tone
[00:27.40]You're slowly letting go
[00:33.17]Are you turning off your phone? Ooh
[00:39.18]Feelings turn cold
[00:43.01]So cold for you
[00:54.98]So cold for you
[01:09.15]Oh, I try to break apart
[01:21.41]You don't wanna try no more, oh, no more
[01:33.23]Why, why, oh, do you live in my mind, mind? Oh
[01:43.71]Said you looked past my love, oh
[01:49.77]While I came with open arms
[01:54.89]For you, ooh
[02:06.59]For you, ooh
