[00:00.00]
[00:23.14]Touch my body tender
[00:27.67]'Cause the feeling makes me weak
[00:33.48]Kicking off the covers
[00:37.96]I see the ceiling while you're looking down at me
[00:44.13]How can we go back to being friends
[00:48.91]When we just shared a bed?
[00:54.45]How can you look at me and pretend
[00:59.30]I'm someone you've never met?
[01:04.50]It was last December
[01:08.99]You were laying on my chest
[01:14.81]I still remember
[01:19.37]I was scared to take a breath
[01:22.25]Didn't want you to move your head
[01:25.47]How can we go back to being friends
[01:30.30]When we just shared a bed?
[01:35.75]How can you look at me and pretend
[01:40.60]I'm someone you've never met?
[01:45.80]The devil in your eyes
[01:52.64]Won't deny the lies you've sold
[01:58.80]I'm holding on too tight
[02:02.54]While you let go
[02:04.87]This is casual
[02:09.65]
[02:17.16]How can we go back to being friends
[02:21.94]When we just shared a bed?
[02:27.33]How can you look at me and pretend
[02:32.29]I'm someone you've never met?
[02:37.75]How can we go back to being friends
[02:42.60]When we just shared a bed?
[02:48.10]How can you look at me and pretend
[02:52.97]I'm someone you've never met?
[02:57.23]
[03:00.35]I'm someone you've never met
